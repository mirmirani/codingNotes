<blockquote>
        Thank you, it's great to be here for this
        debate, even though, of course I as an
        anarchist question this simple dichotomy the word collapse.
        It is very interesting because my work in
        framing the future as being one of
        energy descent specifically rejects the
        idea that civilization is actually going
        to fall off a cliff but actually what is
        inevitable no matter what any of us or
        anyone on the planet does individually
        or collectively Humanity is headed for a
        future where there's a continuous
        reduction in the energy and resources
        available to each generation for many
        many generations into the future and
        that is the framework within which
        permaculture forty years ago reflecting
        the evidence of the limits to growth was
        framed... <br><br>
